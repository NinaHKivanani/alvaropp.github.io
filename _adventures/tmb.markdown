title: Tour du Mont Blanc
description: hiking trip
brief: Set off with a friend to complete a lap of the Tour du Mont Blanc in the Alps. 6 days and a half to complete 160km+ with 12,000m of positive and negative climb, pretty much in self-sufficiency. Along the way we encountered snow storms and extremely wet days, but also warm sunshine and beautiful landscapes.
