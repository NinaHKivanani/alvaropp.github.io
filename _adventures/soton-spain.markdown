title: Southampton - Spain
description: road bikepacking trip
brief: Road and dirt road cycling trip from my place in Southampton to my partner's family town in Spain, Malillos. The whole journey took 12 days, not including a ferry crossing from Portsmouth to St-Malo, and I rode my Triban 520 road bike with a lightweight bikepacking setup given the (too) warm summer weather. 23th July - 5th August 2018.
