description: Guildford
brief: Inspired by <a href="http://davis.vilums.me/all-the-streets/" target="_blank">Davis Vilums</a> and <a href="https://imjustwalkin.com/" target="_blank">Matt Green</a>, I've started walking and cycling all the streets and paths in Guildford Borough. This is just a way of turning something that I was kind of doing already into a more systematic and data rich project that can make the COVID-19 lockdown more enjoyable.

The idea is to visit every street, road, path and trail in Guildford Borough using my feet and my bikes. I record these activities using Komoot and embed the routes in an interactive map that should be getting fuller with time. This map is available [here](http://alvarop.me/keep-exploring/){:target="_ blank"} and embedded in the following frame:
