abstract = {Motivated by the high electric vehicle (EV) penetration percentages foreseen for the near future, this paper studies the participation of large fleets of EVs in electricity day-ahead markets. Specifically, we consider a scenariowhere a number of independent and self-interested EV aggregators participate in the day-ahead market to purchase energy to satisfy their clients' driving needs. In this scenario, independent bidding can drive prices up unnecessarily, resulting in increased electricity costs for all participants. Inter-aggregator cooperation can mitigate this by pro- ducing coordinated bids. However, this is challenging due to the self-interested nature of the aggregators, who may try to manipulate the system in order to obtain personal benefit. In order to overcome this issue, we employ techniques from mechanism design to develop a coordination mechanism which incentivises self-interested EV aggregators to report their energy requirements truthfully to a third-party coordinator. This coordinator is then able to employ a day-ahead bidding algorithm to optimise the global bids on their behalf, extending the benefits of smart bidding to groups of competing EV aggregators. Importantly, the proposed coordination mechanism is straightforward to implement and does not require any additional infrastructure. To ensure scalability and com- putational tractability, a novel price-maker day-ahead bidding algorithmis proposed, which is formulated in terms of simple energy requirement constraints. The coordination mechanism substantially reduces bidding costs, as shown in a case study which uses real market and driver data from the Iberian Peninsula.},

@article{Granath2016,
abstract = {We study the equilibrium distribution of relative strategy scores of agents in the asymmetric phase ($\alpha$ ≡ P/N {\textgreater} 1) of the basic Minority Game using sign-payoff, with N agents holding two strategies over P histories.We formulate a statistical model that makes use of the gauge freedom with respect to the ordering of an agent's strategies to quantify the correlation between the attendance and the distribution of strategies. The relative score x ∈ Z of the two strategies of an agent is described in terms of a one dimensional random walk with asymmetric jump probabilities, leading either to a static and asymmetric exponential distribution centered at x = 0 for fickle agents or to diffusion with a positive or negative drift for frozen agents. In terms of scaled coordinates x/√N and t/N the distributions are uniquely given by $\alpha$ and in quantitative agreement with direct simulations of the game. As themodel avoids the reformulation in terms of a constrainedminimization problem it can be used for arbitrary payoff functions with little calculational effort and provides a transparent and simple formulation of the dynamics of the basic Minority Game in the asymmetric phase.},

It makes use of existing software libraries such as mcpi and RaspberryJam-Mod, and tries to improve and ease the programming experience. A non-traditional programming workflow using Jupyter Notebook is also proposed to complement the mod. This project was carried at the University of Southampton.},
