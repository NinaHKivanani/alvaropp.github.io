[//]: # (Supports Font-Awesome and Academicons)

I am a Research Data Scientist at [Senseye.io](https://www.senseye.io){:target="_blank"}, working on a variety of topics including both supervised and unsupervised learning.

Formerly, I did a PhD in the [Agents, Interaction and Complexity](https://www.aic.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) group, at the University of Southampton in the UK. My research studied the interaction between large fleets of electric vehicles and electricity markets. By using techniques from different fields of AI, we were able to coordinate the charging of electric vehicles in order to achieve lower prices and reduced congestion. More information about my research can be found in the [publications](/publications) section.

In my free time, I frequently engage in side projects which usually lie somewhere between computer science, electronics and education. These experiments occasionally get featured in cool websites and magazines, or win small prizes. Relevant projects I've worked on can be found in the [projects](/projects) section.

I also enjoy the outdoors and practising sports, specially long-distance running, cycling or walking. I am slowly building a collection of my top trips and adventures, which can be found in the [adventures](/adventures) section.
