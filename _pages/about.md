[//]: # (Supports Font-Awesome and Academicons)

I am a PhD student in the [Agents, Interaction and Complexity](https://www.aic.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) group, at the University of Southampton in the UK. I also belong to the [Next Generation Computational Modelling](http://ngcm.soton.ac.uk/) Doctoral Training Centre, in the same University.

My research studies the interaction between large fleets of electric vehicles and electricity markets.
In more detail, we explore the simultaneous participation of a number of electric vehicle aggregators in day-ahead markets.
In such scenario, in order to reduce costs, polluting emissions and improve the functioning of the electricity grid, cooperation among the aggregators is greatly beneficial. However, due to their self-interested nature, this cooperation is challenging and requires carefully designed coordination mechanisms which provide cooperation incentives and discourage strategic manipulation. More information about my research can be found in the [publications](/publications) section.

Aside from academic work, I frequently develop side projects which usually lie somewhere between computer science, electronics and education. These experiments occasionally get featured in cool websites and magazines, or win small prizes. Relevant projects I've worked on can be found in the [projects](/projects) section.
